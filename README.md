Simple/tiny jQuery replacement/alternative library ðŸ˜›

YoktoJS is supposed to be used with VanillaJS, using any library/frameworks* parallelly might bug things up!
---
\*library/frameworks as in: jQuery, etc.  (Basically any library/framework that uses `$_`, `$`, `$$`, `_`, `__` since Yokto uses it.)
